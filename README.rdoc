= Edge State Machine

The gem is based on Rick Olson's code of ActiveModel::StateMachine,
axed from ActiveModel in {this
commit}[http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/db49c706b62e7ea2ab93f05399dbfddf5087ee0c].

And on Krzysiek HerÃ³d's gem, {Transitions}[https://github.com/netizer/transitions], which added Mongoid support.
